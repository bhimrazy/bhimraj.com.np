## Description

> This project is a part of **KU HackFest 2022**

The main purpose of this project is to automate the process of COVID-19 diagnosis
and help radiologists, doctors and patients in their process by saving their precious time.
So, by using a trained model on COVID chest-X-ray images, It assists medical staff and radiologists
to detect the presence/sign of COVID in the chest-x-ray images reducing the workloads and speeding up the
diagnosis.

## Installation
